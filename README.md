# testimonials-grid-section
This is a solution to Testimonials Grid Section challenge from Frontendmentor.io
This was a great challenge to practice and hone my CSS Grid skills. I did my best to make it look as close to the design as possible.

First I did the Html Markup and then proceeded to do the css for mobile screens and finnally used media query to order the testimonial cards for wider screens.
